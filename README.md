# Unmasking Memorization: Assessing Dutch Language Memorization in mT5 Models

This repository consists of the files used for my Master's thesis which assesses the level of Dutch Language memorization in mT5 models. All pre-processing and analysis scripts can be found here, along with the thesis document.

Note, the data and corresponding results files are omitted from this repository. The 'Data' section in the thesis describes how and where the data is obtained.
